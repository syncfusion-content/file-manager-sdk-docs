# Rendering Flat JSON Data in the Vue File Manager Component

The File Manager uses a flat data JSON as an array of objects for rendering, eliminating the need to define [ajaxSettings](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/file-manager#ajaxsettings) url. To load a folder data as an array of objects, use the [Vue File Manager](https://www.syncfusion.com/vue-components/vue-file-manager) component [fileSystemData](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/file-manager#filesystemdata) property with a type of [fileData](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/file-manager/fileData) interface. This means you no longer need to use a separate service provider, as you can integrate services like Google, Amazon, Azure, and others directly into your code using the FileManager's action events.

**Event Information**

## Local data

The FileManager can be populated with local data that contains the array of [fileData](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/file-manager/fileData) interface objects with [parentId](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/file-manager/fileData#parentid) mapping.

To render the root-level folder, specify the `parentId` as null, or there is no need to specify the `parentId` in the array of `fileData` interface objects.
