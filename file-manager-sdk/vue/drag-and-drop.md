# Drag and Drop in Vue File Manager

The Vue File Manager allows files or folders to be moved from one folder to another by using the  [allowDragAndDrop](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/file-manager#allowdraganddrop) property. It also supports uploading files by dragging them from Windows Explorer to the Vue File Manager control. You can enable or disable this feature by using the [allowDragAndDrop](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/file-manager#allowdraganddrop) property.

The drag-and-drop operation raises several events that allow handling and customizing behavior:

* [fileDragStart](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/file-manager#filedragstart) — Triggered when dragging a file or folder begins.
* [fileDragging](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/file-manager#filedragging) — Triggered while a file or folder is being dragged.
* [fileDragStop](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/file-manager#filedragstop) — Triggered when a dragged file or folder is about to be dropped on the target.
* [fileDropped](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/vue/documentation/api/file-manager#filedropped) — Triggered after a file or folder has been dropped.
