# Drag and drop in React File Manager component

The File Manager allows files or folders to be moved from one folder to another by using the  [allowDragAndDrop](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/file-manager#allowdraganddrop) property. It also supports uploading a file by dragging it from Windows Explorer to  File Manager component. You can enable or disable this support by using the [allowDragAndDrop](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/file-manager#allowdraganddrop) property of File Manager.

The event triggered in drag and drop support are

* [fileDragStart](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/file-manager#filedragstart) - Triggers when the file/folder dragging is started.
* [fileDragging](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/file-manager#filedragging) - Triggers while dragging the file/folder.
* [fileDragStop](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/file-manager#filedragstop) - Triggers when the file/folder is about to be dropped at the target.
* [fileDropped](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/file-manager#filedropped) - Triggers when the file/folder is dropped.
