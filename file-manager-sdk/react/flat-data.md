# Rendering Flat JSON Data in the React File Manager Component

The File Manager uses a flat data JSON as an array of objects for rendering, eliminating the need to define [ajaxSettings](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/file-manager/index-default#ajaxsettings) url. To load a folder data as an array of objects, use the File Manager component's [fileSystemData](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/file-manager/index-default#filesystemdata) property with a type of [fileData](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/file-manager/filedata) interface. This means you no longer need to use a separate service provider, as you can integrate services like Google, Amazon, Azure, and others directly into your code using the File Manager's action events.

**Event Information**

Event Name | Description
 ---  | ---
[beforeDelete](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/file-manager/index-default#beforedelete) | This event is triggered before the deletion of a file or folder occurs.

[delete](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/file-manager/index-default#delete) | This event is triggered after the file or folder is deleted successfully. The deleted file or folder details can be retrieved here. Additionally, custom elements' visibility can be managed here based on the application's use case.
[beforeFolderCreate](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/file-manager/index-default#beforefoldercreate) | This event is triggered before a folder is created. It allows for the restriction of folder creation based on the application's use case.

[move](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/file-manager/index-default#move) | This event is triggered when a file or folder is pasted into the destination path.

## Local data

The File Manager can be populated with local data that contains the array of [fileData](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/file-manager/filedata) interface objects with [parentId](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/file-manager/fileData#parentid) mapping.

To render the root-level folder, specify the `parentId` as null, or there is no need to specify the `parentId` in the array of `fileData` interface objects.
